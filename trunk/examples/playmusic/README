Installation (Generic Linux)
============================

By default the application will run from the current folder but it's possible
to install it manually if you do the following:

    cp playmusic /usr/local/bin/
    cp playmusic.desktop /usr/local/share/applications/
    cp playmusic.svg /usr/local/share/icons/hicolor/scalable/apps/
    mkdir /usr/local/share/playmusic
    cp background.png func* /usr/local/share/playmusic/

You'll need to make sure that PACKAGE_DATA_DIR within and towards the top of
playmusic points to the correct path i.e. /usr/local/share/playmusic if that's
where you installed background.png and func*

Requirements
============

Gtkdialog >= 0.8.0 - http://code.google.com/p/gtkdialog/

Configuration
=============

Run playmusic and select quit. Open ~/.playmusic/playmusicrc and edit it.
You'll likely want to set-up the required audio players for your system amd
there's plenty of documentation in there to assist you. If you're using bash
then set use_bashisms=1 to activate the faster bash builtin commands.

Execution
=========

Usage: playmusic [FILE or FOLDER]

A FILE creates a playlist of the folder non-recursively and plays the file.
A FOLDER creates a playlist of the folder recursively and plays the first file.
No arguments resumes playing the last playlist and the last file played.

Operation
=========

Left-clicking the track details toggles between album/artist and track.

Left-clicking the cover navigates to the next folder if one exists.
Right-clicking the cover navigates to the previous folder if one exists.
Middle-clicking the cover will open the cover full-size in another window.

Covers (cover.png/jpg/bmp etc.) are searched for within the music folders.
