- The menu widget is in fact a menuitem widget with a submenu, so it's
  created the same way as any other menuitem which means it can now have
  an icon and the "activate" signal works on selection.
- Submenus now work by nesting menu widgets (menu == menuitem+submenu).
- Deprecated "icon" and "stock" and replaced with "imgicon" and
  "imgstock" and added "imgfile" which supports scaled images from files.

* Mon Jul 25 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Added <visible> directive support to the menu widget.

* Sun Jul 24 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Added tag attribute support to the menu widget which means it's now
  possible to set label="_File" use-underline="true".
- Added the "margin" custom tag attribute to the window widget to
  control the border-width as it was previously hardcoded to 5. This
  now makes it possible to pull the menubar up into the corners.
- Added the "margin" custom tag attribute to the hbox and vbox widgets.

* Sat Jul 23 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Tidied-up the create_menuitem function (preparatory work in readiness
  for extending the menuitems) and now the GTK properties "use-stock"
  and "label" work together as expected.

* Wed Jul 20 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Added support for menuitem accelerators via the "accel-key" and
  "accel-mods" custom tag attributes and both values can be entered as
  either decimal or hexadecimal integers (when you see gdk/gdkkeysyms.h
  you'll know why ;) ). gdk/gdktypes.h holds the modifier values.

* Mon Jul 18 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Overhauled the entry widget:
- Fixed the exclusive default signal i.e. it wasn't possible to have a
  default action and another action specifying the same signal.
- Removed the odd manual emission of the default "changed" signal when
  using the fileselect function i.e. inserting text.
- Fixed widget_entry_refresh which wasn't distinguishing between <input>
  and <input file> directives (file loading wasn't implemented anyway)
  and then attempted to execute the <input file> if declared.
- Added support for the save function (now a full action function set).
- Added support for the custom tag attribute "block-function-signals".
- Added support for the "activate" signal emitted from pressing Enter.
- Added support for the "icon-press" and "icon-release" signals,
  actually prefixed with "primary-" or "secondary-" to distinguish
  between them.

* Sun Jul 17 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Added a custom tag attribute called "block-function-signals" that's
  currently being used in the h/vscale code, but it can be applied to
  other widgets if required. It blocks signal emissions when functions
  are being performed (refresh etc.) so that application developers can
  isolate signals originating from user widget manipulation.

* Sat Jul 16 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Updated the long forgotten about widget_get_type_from_pointer() which
  was in widgets.c and used exclusively by glade_support.c. I came across
  it whilst searching and found it to be only accounting for 20% of the
  widgets and I don't know what impact this would have had if any since
  only one application is using Glade. I've moved it to glade_support.c.

* Thu Jul 14 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Deprecated the badly named menu item <separator> widget and added an
  equivalent <menuitemseparator> (I'm reviewing the menu system).

* Wed Jul 13 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- New widget: <hscale>.
- New widget: <vscale>.
- Connected up the GtkScale's "value_changed" signal in glade_support.c.

* Fri Jul 8 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Overhauled the copyright and license notices atop most source files.
  Quite a few were missing, some were only snippets of the license and
  some weren't attributed to anyone. Where applicable I've included
  myself in the copyright notices since I've introduced a fair amount of
  code now. Everything is now consistently (C) 2003-2007 László Pere
  which correctly covers the period of all of his work.
- Started adding the new hscale and vscale widgets.

* Thu Jul 7 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- New widget: <comboboxentry></comboboxentry>, full action function set.
- Modified the behaviour of the comboboxentry widget's default directive
  so that text that isn't matched to any list items becomes the default
  entry text instead; very useful with has-focus="true".

* Wed Jul 6 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Modified the button and pixmap widgets' refresh functions so that
  images are only refreshed when the widgets have been realized.
- Fixed the gtkdialog_lexer.l errors I found as reported in issue 11.

* Tue Jul 5 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Added image positioning support to buttons with images and labels.

* Mon Jul 4 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Connected up the GtkComboBox's "changed" signal in glade_support.c.

* Sat Jul 2 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Added a 2.20.0 GTK+ version check for gtk_widget_get_realized and on
  false will use the deprecated GTK_WIDGET_REALIZED macro.
- Added code to widget_signal_executor to automate managing the default
  signal for widget types.
- Added comboboxtext default signal support for action and action type
  directives.

* Fri Jul 1 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- New widget: <comboboxtext></comboboxtext>, full action function set.

* Thu Jun 30 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Fixed three bugs in glade_support.c that were checking that command
  wasn't NULL when they should've been checking full_command instead
  (likely an initial mistake and then copied and pasted).
  
* Sat Jun 25 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Added width and height tag attribute support for the scrollable hbox
  and vbox to control the viewport dimensions.
- "selection_mode" will now accept 3, 2, 1, or 0 as well as multiple,
  browse, single and none. This makes it consistent with the existing
  selection-mode GtkCList (<table>) property.
- New widget: <hseparator tagattr></hseparator>.
- New widget: <vseparator tagattr></vseparator>.
  
* Fri Jun 24 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Added hbox and vbox widget scrolling capability via the "scrollable"
  custom attribute. If scrollable="true/yes/1" then the box is placed
  inside a GtkScrolledWindow by the existing put_in_the_scrolled_window
  function.

* Thu Jun 23 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Simplified the search for the "selection_mode" custom attribute in
  create_tree as I found a function that finds them and returns their
  values. Also, since there exists a GTK "selection-mode" property for
  other unrelated widgets I don't now distinguish between a "_" and "-".

* Tue Jun 21 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Function remove_selected_variable has been updated to accommodate the
  extended range of tree widget selection modes.

* Mon Jun 20 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Function widget_get_text_value has been updated to accommodate the
  extended range of tree widget selection modes.

* Sat Jun 18 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>

  text column (after the icon column if any). Check file 09.12-tree_one_column
  for example.

* Sun Feb 18 2007 Laszlo Pere <pipas@linux.pte.hu> 0.7.18
- Better icon handling in tree views. See the following example programs:

  button-release-event handlers. See 09.02-tree_actions for example.

* Wed Nov 29 2006 Laszlo Pere <pipas@linux.pte.hu> 0.7.11
- The widget properties are set only when the widget is realized. This
  modification has been made because some properties can be set only if there
  is a parent window. (See 16.02.widget_properties_default for example)

* Mon Nov 27 2006 Laszlo Pere <pipas@linux.pte.hu> 0.7.10

- Bugfix: "launch" action is fixed.
- Most of the compile time warnings are eliminated.
- Actions have two forms now. The simple form is an XML attribute like this:

  This form can be used when creating the GUI with Glade, where the callback
  function name is used by the GtkDialog as a command to execute. 
  The older
  <action clear>VARIABLE</action> 
  form is no longer recognized.
- Bugfix: Label from file buffer overrun fixed.
- Bugfix: Frame without label caused a segfault. Now fixed.
