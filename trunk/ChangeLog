* Tue Aug 30 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Fixed the tree widget's <input file> directive.
- Fixed examples 09.01-tree_attributes, 09.01-tree_items and
  09.02-tree_default_pixmaps and added list.txt.

* Mon Aug 29 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- New widget: <statusbar>.
- Modified save_menuitem_to_file to save "true" or "false" to make it
  consistent with the togglebutton widget.

* Thu Aug 25 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Overhauled the fileselect action function which includes file filters.
- Added a list_t_free() function to free list_t structs if required.

* Tue Aug 23 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Modified icon from theme code so that a gtk-missing-image is shown
  when an image isn't found, similar to the image from file code.
- Tweaked the button image loading code to better accommodate the
  togglebutton's <input> directive.
- Added support for the save action function to the togglebutton widget.

* Mon Aug 22 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- New widget: <togglebutton>.
- Purged almost all of the code marked redundant.
- Added widget_template.c/h which I've been using for a while now.

* Sun Aug 21 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Fixed invisible-char in 02.01-entry_attributes as it is a guint not a
  gchar (it worked before because the guint code was bugged).
- Updated a few examples by replacing deprecated directives.

* Sat Aug 20 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Added signals.c/h.

* Fri Aug 19 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Started to implement the togglebutton widget (create works so far).
- Fixed a bug when freeing accel_groups: it needed to be set to NULL.

* Thu Aug 18 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Added widget_button.c/h.
- Added "use-underline" support to buttons with a label directive.

* Wed Aug 17 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Added "tab-prefix", "tab-suffix" and "tab-base-index" custom tag
  attributes to the notebook widget to control automated page labelling.
  I've also added "tab-labels" to replace the existing "labels".

* Tue Aug 16 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Re-engineered a few functions within attributes.c that needed to be
  reentrant but weren't. The pointer being used to record the currently
  referenced element in an AttributeSet (a GList) was being stored within
  the AttributeSet when it should have been stored within the calling
  function. For example, clicking a button on a notebook page would emit
  a signal and an action would change the page, then GTK+ would hide the
  page including button which would emit signals for the button which
  would then iterate through the same actions causing the pointer to be
  updated amd corrupting the original loop. Yeah, it took some finding.
- Reviewed and extended the <notebook> widget: Now the page number is
  stored within the variable and it can be refreshed from a command or
  file making it possible to use another widget to change the page.

* Fri Aug 12 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Added GTK_CHECK_VERSION for gtk_widget_get_sensitive which'll use the
  deprecated GTK_WIDGET_SENSITIVE if older than 2.18.0.
- Deprecated the <visible>disabled</visible> directive in favour
  of <sensitive>false/no/0</sensitive> which is what it actually is.
- Fixed the hardcoded "gtkdialog" binary name in main.

* Thu Aug 11 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- New widget: <timer> with a custom "tick" signal.

* Wed Aug 10 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Connected-up the primary and secondary icon-press/release signals for
  the new spinbutton widget -- it's effectively an entry widget + scale,
  therefore all the GtkEntry properties apply too.
- Connected-up the changed signal for the new spinbutton widget.

* Tue Aug 9 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Modified token_store_with_argument_attr to convert signal names passed
  in from the XML separated with underscores to hyphenated strings
  (GTK+ doesn't distinguish between the two, so now we don't).
- New widget: <spinbutton>.
- Added default messages for unimplemented directives for widgets that
  I've so far refactored or recently added.

* Mon Aug 8 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Fixed an existing bug in try_set_property, the function that passes
  the tag attributes that are GTK+ widget properties to GTK+ to be set.
  The part that should have been converting a char to a guint was
  converting a char to a [UTF8] char which resulted in all guint GTK+
  widget properties being bugged; therefore "border_width" now works.
- Deprecated the "margin" custom tag attribute and removed from docs.
- Started to implement the spinbutton widget.

* Sun Aug 7 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Fixed a bug I added to the pixmap widget that caused a segfault.
- Updated the menuitem widget to support custom tag attributes of
  "stock[-id]", "icon[-name]" and "image-name" plus underscores. This
  is consistent with the extended names accepted by the tree widget.
- Updated the menuitem widget to support using the height or width
  directives to override the default theme icon size of 16.

* Sat Aug 6 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Added theme icon support to the pixmap widget: the height or width
  directives can be used to specify the "size" else it defaults to 32.
- Tweaked the new widget template somewhat.
- Renamed main.c to gtkdialog.c and main.h to gtkdialog.h.
- Updated the button widget to support using the height or width
  directives to override the default theme icon size of 20.

* Fri Aug 5 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Updated the old TODO although I'm using the issue tracker myself.
- Added widget_pixmap.c/h, the start of my refactoring intentions.
- Fixed examples 09.00-tree, 09.12-tree_one_column including list.sh.
- Added widget_comboboxtext.c/h.

* Mon Aug 1 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- The overhaul of the menu system is now complete. New checkbox,
  radiobutton and image from file menuitem widgets added and refresh and
  save action functions implemented.

* Sun Jul 31 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Discovered that the menuitems aren't realized until the menu is opened
  which means that using gtk_widget_get_realized is pointless. I've now
  replaced that within the refresh functions with an item of widget data
  named "initialised" which marks the widgets at start-up. I believe
  this is also going to be an issue with the notebook widget so the
  on_any_widget_realized method of setting tag attributes is going to
  require changing else properties won't be set until widgets get shown
  and an action function could have changed them in that time.
- Re-engineered the "block-function-signals" code so that I don't have
  to micro-manage signal handler IDs. Instead I set a global flag which
  blocks execute_action from executing any action functions. The check
  for "block-function-signals" is now done not within specific widget
  functions but at a higher level so theoretically all widgets now
  support blocking signals from action functions.

* Sat Jul 30 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Reviewed the examples, fixed a few more, commented within 17 of them.

* Fri Jul 29 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Fixed exported_column being 1 based within the examples
  09.02-tree_actions, 09.10-tree_icon_stocks and 09.11-tree_icon_names.
- Fixed all the shebangs (bashim) within the examples and used
  GTKDIALOG=gtkdialog so that they can all be easily changed with sed.
- Fixed 05.01-progress_bar_closewindow: closewindow issue.
- Fixed 05.02-progress_bar_test: closewindow issue.
- Fixed 06.00-pixmap: missing image.
- Fixed various other examples and identified the non-working ones.

* Thu Jul 28 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Set the default checkbox menuitem signal to "toggled".
- Added checkbox menuitem support for conditional function execution.
- Added the radiobutton menuitem widget (grouped by any non radiobutton
  menuitem widget), set the default signal to "toggled" and added support
  for conditional function execution.

* Wed Jul 27 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- The menu widget is in fact a menuitem widget with a submenu, so it's
  created the same way as any other menuitem which means it can now have
  an icon and the "activate" signal works on selection.
- Submenus now work by nesting menu widgets (menu == menuitem+submenu).
- Deprecated "icon" and "stock" and replaced with "imgicon" and
  "imgstock" and added "imgfile" which supports scaled images from files.
- Renamed "imgicon", "imgstock" and "imgfile" to "image-icon",
  "image-stock" and "image-file".
- Added the checkbox menuitem and checkbox="state" custom tag attribute.

* Mon Jul 25 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Added <visible> directive support to the menu widget.

* Sun Jul 24 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Added tag attribute support to the menu widget which means it's now
  possible to set label="_File" use-underline="true".
- Added the "margin" custom tag attribute to the window widget to
  control the border-width as it was previously hardcoded to 5. This
  now makes it possible to pull the menubar up into the corners.
- Added the "margin" custom tag attribute to the hbox and vbox widgets.

* Sat Jul 23 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Tidied-up the create_menuitem function (preparatory work in readiness
  for extending the menuitems) and now the GTK properties "use-stock"
  and "label" work together as expected.

* Wed Jul 20 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Added support for menuitem accelerators via the "accel-key" and
  "accel-mods" custom tag attributes and both values can be entered as
  either decimal or hexadecimal integers (when you see gdk/gdkkeysyms.h
  you'll know why ;) ). gdk/gdktypes.h holds the modifier values.

* Mon Jul 18 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Overhauled the entry widget:
- Fixed the exclusive default signal i.e. it wasn't possible to have a
  default action and another action specifying the same signal.
- Removed the odd manual emission of the default "changed" signal when
  using the fileselect function i.e. inserting text.
- Fixed widget_entry_refresh which wasn't distinguishing between <input>
  and <input file> directives (file loading wasn't implemented anyway)
  and then attempted to execute the <input file> if declared.
- Added support for the save function (now a full action function set).
- Added support for the custom tag attribute "block-function-signals".
- Added support for the "activate" signal emitted from pressing Enter.
- Added support for the "icon-press" and "icon-release" signals,
  actually prefixed with "primary-" or "secondary-" to distinguish
  between them.

* Sun Jul 17 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Added a custom tag attribute called "block-function-signals" that's
  currently being used in the h/vscale code, but it can be applied to
  other widgets if required. It blocks signal emissions when functions
  are being performed (refresh etc.) so that application developers can
  isolate signals originating from user widget manipulation.

* Sat Jul 16 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Updated the long forgotten about widget_get_type_from_pointer() which
  was in widgets.c and used exclusively by glade_support.c. I came across
  it whilst searching and found it to be only accounting for 20% of the
  widgets and I don't know what impact this would have had if any since
  only one application is using Glade. I've moved it to glade_support.c.

* Thu Jul 14 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Deprecated the badly named menu item <separator> widget and added an
  equivalent <menuitemseparator> (I'm reviewing the menu system).

* Wed Jul 13 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- New widget: <hscale>.
- New widget: <vscale>.
- Connected up the GtkScale's "value_changed" signal in glade_support.c.

* Fri Jul 8 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Overhauled the copyright and license notices atop most source files.
  Quite a few were missing, some were only snippets of the license and
  some weren't attributed to anyone. Where applicable I've included
  myself in the copyright notices since I've introduced a fair amount of
  code now. Everything is now consistently (C) 2003-2007 László Pere
  which correctly covers the period of all of his work.
- Started adding the new hscale and vscale widgets.

* Thu Jul 7 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- New widget: <comboboxentry></comboboxentry>, full action function set.
- Modified the behaviour of the comboboxentry widget's default directive
  so that text that isn't matched to any list items becomes the default
  entry text instead; very useful with has-focus="true".

* Wed Jul 6 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Modified the button and pixmap widgets' refresh functions so that
  images are only refreshed when the widgets have been realized.
- Fixed the gtkdialog_lexer.l errors I found as reported in issue 11.

* Tue Jul 5 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Added image positioning support to buttons with images and labels.

* Mon Jul 4 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Connected up the GtkComboBox's "changed" signal in glade_support.c.

* Sat Jul 2 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Added a 2.20.0 GTK+ version check for gtk_widget_get_realized and on
  false will use the deprecated GTK_WIDGET_REALIZED macro.
- Added code to widget_signal_executor to automate managing the default
  signal for widget types.
- Added comboboxtext default signal support for action and action type
  directives.

* Fri Jul 1 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- New widget: <comboboxtext></comboboxtext>, full action function set.

* Thu Jun 30 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Fixed three bugs in glade_support.c that were checking that command
  wasn't NULL when they should've been checking full_command instead
  (likely an initial mistake and then copied and pasted).
  
* Sat Jun 25 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Added width and height tag attribute support for the scrollable hbox
  and vbox to control the viewport dimensions.
- "selection_mode" will now accept 3, 2, 1, or 0 as well as multiple,
  browse, single and none. This makes it consistent with the existing
  selection-mode GtkCList (<table>) property.
- New widget: <hseparator tagattr></hseparator>.
- New widget: <vseparator tagattr></vseparator>.
  
* Fri Jun 24 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Added hbox and vbox widget scrolling capability via the "scrollable"
  custom attribute. If scrollable="true/yes/1" then the box is placed
  inside a GtkScrolledWindow by the existing put_in_the_scrolled_window
  function.

* Thu Jun 23 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Simplified the search for the "selection_mode" custom attribute in
  create_tree as I found a function that finds them and returns their
  values. Also, since there exists a GTK "selection-mode" property for
  other unrelated widgets I don't now distinguish between a "_" and "-".

* Tue Jun 21 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Function remove_selected_variable has been updated to accommodate the
  extended range of tree widget selection modes.

* Mon Jun 20 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Function widget_get_text_value has been updated to accommodate the
  extended range of tree widget selection modes.

* Sat Jun 18 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>

- Removed unnecessary code from find_pixmap (locate etc.).
- Applied the Debian 02_documentation_paths /usr/local/bin/ patch.
- Added missing conversion type characters from tag_attributes.c:102.
- Added missing declaration in widgets.h:24.
- Added missing __func__ in variables.c:393.
- Added missing (char*) casts in variables.c:758 and 760.

- default policy changed ror crolled windows.
- The segfault handling the --geometry option is fixed.
- Better handling of the command line options.

* Sun Feb 25 2007 Laszlo Pere <pipas@linux.pte.hu> 0.7.19
- The "exported_column" attribute for trees is fixed. Column 0 means the first
  text column (after the icon column if any). Check file 09.12-tree_one_column
  for example.

* Sun Feb 18 2007 Laszlo Pere <pipas@linux.pte.hu> 0.7.18
- Better icon handling in tree views. See the following example programs:
  o 09.01-tree_items
  o 09.02-tree_default_pixmaps
  o 09.03-tree_icon_columns

* Tue Jan 11 2007 Laszlo Pere <pipas@linux.pte.hu> 0.7.14
- Compile error fixed by Jean-Philippe Guillemin.

* Wed Jan 10 2007 Laszlo Pere <pipas@linux.pte.hu> 0.7.13
- Handling of input for the tree widgets (see example 09.00-tree).

* Tue Jan 02 2007 Laszlo Pere <pipas@linux.pte.hu> 0.7.12
- The mouse button is exported for the button-press-event and
  button-release-event handlers. See 09.02-tree_actions for example.

* Wed Nov 29 2006 Laszlo Pere <pipas@linux.pte.hu> 0.7.11
- The widget properties are set only when the widget is realized. This
  modification has been made because some properties can be set only if there
  is a parent window. (See 16.02.widget_properties_default for example)

* Mon Nov 27 2006 Laszlo Pere <pipas@linux.pte.hu> 0.7.10
- GtkWidget signal actions for the following signal names:
  "button-press-event"
  "button-release-event"
  "configure-event"
  "enter-notify-event"
  "leave-notify-event"
  "focus-in-event"
  "focus-out-event"
  "key-press-event"
  "key-release-event"
  "hide"
  "show"
  "map-event"
  "unmap-event"
  See example file 16.01.widget_signals.

* Mon Nov 15 2006 Laszlo Pere <pipas@linux.pte.hu> 0.7.9
- Bugfix: Window delete-event handler exits only if that was the last window.
- Bugfix: Closewindow action exits if that was the last window.
- Menu items with named icons. See 14.01-menubar_icons for example.

* Tue Nov 7 2006 Laszlo Pere <pipas@linux.pte.hu> 0.7.8
- Some code clean up with the progress bars and parent windows.

* Mon Nov 6 2006 Laszlo Pere <pipas@linux.pte.hu> 0.7.7

- Bugfix: "closewindow: xxx not found" error is fixed.
- Bugfix: "launch" action is fixed.
- Most of the compile time warnings are eliminated.
- Actions have two forms now. The simple form is an XML attribute like this:
  <action type="exit">VALUE</action>
  the secondary form is a command prefix:
  <action>Exit:VALUE</action>
  This form can be used when creating the GUI with Glade, where the callback
  function name is used by the GtkDialog as a command to execute. 
  The older
  <action clear>VARIABLE</action> 
  form is no longer recognized.
- Bugfix: Label from file buffer overrun fixed.
- Bugfix: Frame without label caused a segfault. Now fixed.
- Bugfix: Compiling problem when no Glade library found is fixed.
- Bugfix: Closewindow action for progress_bars fixed 
  (see the 05.01-progress_bar_closewindow example program)

* Thu Oct 26 2006 Laszlo Pere <pipas@linux.pte.hu> 0.7.4
- A better glade support. See glade files in the examples directory. 
- Launch/Closewindow bug is fixed by Jean-Philippe Guillemin.

- <input></input> for labels. See '00.02-text_input' for example.
- Syntax error with one character unescaped strings fixed.
- Attributes can be used to set window icon names. See '15.01.window_attributes'
  for example.
- New widget: <progressbar></progressbar>, see 05.00-progress_bar for example.

* Mon Jun 12 2006 Laszlo Pere <pipas@linux.pte.hu> 0.7.2
- The gtklauncher binary is removed. Use '-e' option of gtkdialog instead.

     <label>Window Title</label>
  </window>
  Sorry about the postfix notation.
- Another version is to use the general attribute setting:
  <window title="Window Title">
    <hbox>...</hbox>
  </window>
- Much better support for the <tree> widget. See examples for more info.
- <editor> handles <default> text.
- The type="fileselect" action creates a file_chooser if compiled with GTK+
  2.4.0 or newer version.
- File select dialog title can be set by the target widget (see example file
  "16-fileselect")
- The behaviour of the file selection dialog can be described by the
  target widget (see example file "16-fileselect").
- New example scheme. It is systematic, trying to substitute the missing
  documentation.
- The <editor> text exported and printed now.
- Better handling of strings and quotes.

* Thu Mar 9 2006 Laszlo Pere <pipas@linux.pte.hu> 0.6.0
- Same as the 0.58.6 which seems to be fairly stable.

* Wed Jul 27 2005 Laszlo Pere <pipas@linux.pte.hu> 0.59.6
- Crash on ia64 bug fixed thanks to David Mosberger and Fabio Tranchitella.
  
* Sun Jan 2 2005 Laszlo Pere <pipas@linux.pte.hu> 0.59.5
- It is possible now to insert multiple columns into the tables using

- New widget: <notebook></notebook> is a grouping widget
- <input></input> is working on checkboxes also.

* Thu Nov 25 2004 Laszlo Pere <pipas@linux.pte.hu> 0.59.0
- New version numbers: this is the unstable version (59 is odd).
- It is possible now to preset radiobuttons with the <default> tag.
- The syntax of --program option is chaged. See --help.

* Wed Nov 24 2004 Laszlo Pere <pipas@linux.pte.hu> 0.58.12
- Environment variable name after the --program option now optional,
the default is: MAIN_WINDOW
- The -geometry option is working as it should be (see "man X")
- Menu can have a command witf type (eg. <command type="insert">)
- The tree widget is much more better now
