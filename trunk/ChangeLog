Please see NEWS for a summary of changes since the last release suitable
for announcements.

* Wed Aug 29 2012 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Added listing of the built-in extra libraries to argument --version.
- Fixed working_directory not being initialised to NULL in terminal.
- Reduced minimum libvte requirements to 0.23.5 (thanks vovchik).
- Added scrolled window to the terminal so now it resizes properly.
- Modified the terminal so that when the user types exit or it is
  killed, its variable -- which contained the pid -- is reset to zero
  and the terminal stays in that state until the application developer
  decides to reset it and re-execute the command with the clear action.

* Tue Aug 28 2012 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Added support for presentwindow.
- Added examples/miscellaneous/presentwindow.
- Added some code to action_launchwindow() to check that a program isn't
  already being parsed as this process is not reetrant and it caused the
  parser to quit with a nonsensical message; now it warns and continues.
- Updated the wiki and the reference docs.

* Mon Aug 27 2012 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Updated the terminal widget: its variable now contains its pid.
- Updated examples/terminal/terminal to output the pid with the signals.
- Added support for clear to the terminal widget.
- Updated the terminal widget: argv0 now defaults to /bin/sh so a
  terminal widget could simply be <terminal></terminal>.
- Added examples/miscellaneous/grabfocus.

* Sun Aug 26 2012 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Updated the terminal widget so that when the user types exit or it is
  killed, the terminal resets and the command is forked again. This will
  happen before the application receives the child-exited signal.

* Sat Aug 25 2012 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Added support for grabfocus to compatible widgets.
- Added examples/terminal/terminal.
- Updated the wiki and the reference docs.

* Fri Aug 24 2012 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- New widget: <terminal> -- requires libvte but is not mandatory.

* Thu Aug 23 2012 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Added examples/miscellaneous/conditional_widget_refreshing.
- Modified ST_TAG_ATTR in the lexer to accommodate "0-9".

* Tue Aug 21 2012 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Added examples/c_embedded/example01 and Makefile by sklimkin.

* Mon Aug 20 2012 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Added support for button horizontal image with label alignment: by
  default the alignment is centred but it can be optionally uniform.
- Added examples/button/button_image_horizontal_alignment.
- Added a default window title bar project icon gtkdialog.png.
- Windows will now default to using icon-name="gtkdialog".

* Sun Aug 19 2012 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Added window tags to a substantial number of old examples because they
  really should be there despite the parser accepting them without and
  it'll stop newcomers experiencing problems writing apps that launch.

* Sat Aug 18 2012 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Added support for activate to compatible widgets.
- Added examples/miscellaneous/activate.

* Fri Aug 17 2012 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>

- Updated the wiki and the reference docs.

* Tue Aug 14 2012 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Added examples/miscellaneous/show_and_hide.

* Sun Aug 12 2012 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Fixed a bug that caused applications that included a menu to fail to
  close via the window manager (title bar) and in fact closewindow too.
- Fixed a bug that caused a parser error when using multiple launched
  windows: the envvar that contained the program was being overwritten.

* Thu Aug 9 2012 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Refactored the menubar widget and updated it in the parser so that it
  now supports the recently added hide and show action functions.

* Wed Aug 8 2012 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Refactored the frame widget and added support for <input>,
  <input file>, enable, disable, show, hide, refresh, save and clear.
- Added support for show and hide to all widgets except those that
  require refactoring and updating in the parser to support directives.
- Refactored the hbox widget and updated it in the parser so that it
  now supports the recently added hide and show action functions.
- Refactored the vbox widget and updated it in the parser so that it
  now supports the recently added hide and show action functions.

* Tue Aug 7 2012 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Added examples/miscellaneous/press_and_release_events.
- Added show and hide action functions.
- Dropped MAXWIDGETS back to 256 since it's per container, not project.

* Mon Aug 6 2012 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Added KEY_VAL, KEY_SYM (both are listed in gdk/gdkkeysyms.h), KEY_UNI
  (the Unicode character if applicable), KEY_MOD (GdkModifierType) and
  KEY_RAW (hardware) envvars on key_press_event and key_release_event.
- Added PTR_X and PTR_Y (widget relative), PTR_MOD (GdkModifierType),
  PTR_BTN (equivalent to the existing BUTTON), PTR_X_ROOT and PTR_Y_ROOT
  (screen relative) envvars on button_press_event/button_release_event.
- Fixed examples/miscellaneous/signals - DIALOG changed to DIALOG_MAIN.

* Sun Aug 5 2012 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Added support for the envvar GTKDIALOG_PIXMAP_PATH to find_pixmap().

* Sat Aug 4 2012 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Refactored the window widget and added support for <input>,
  <input file>, refresh, save and clear ("title" is the item of data
  that is being manipulated).
- Added the "image-name" custom tag attribute for the window widget
  to set the title bar icon from a full path and filename.

* Thu Aug 2 2012 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>

  save.

* Tue Jul 24 2012 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Applied jamesbond's fix for the incorrectly ordered widgets on the
  Raspberry Pi (ARM).

* Thu Nov 22 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Added an example application PlayMusic.

* Thu Oct 6 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Added the option to dump the examples as suggested by Dougal.

* Sun Oct 2 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Fixed a bug that was causing slowness at start-up when loading the
  XML-like GUI description from an environment variable; loading from
  a file or stdin though are fine.

* Mon Sep 26 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Version 0.8.0 released (r306)
- Updated the documentation.

* Sun Sep 25 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Exported the wiki to doc/reference (script included).

* Fri Sep 23 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Added examples/miscellaneous/expand_and_fill.
- Increased MAXWIDGETS from the tiny 256 (21MB virt) to 529 (25MB virt).
  1024 would've been nice but virtual memory jumps to 34MB. The array
  really should be dynamically allocated but it's a job for another day.

* Thu Sep 22 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Added command line option --space-expand to set the widget packing
  expand state at the project level.
- Added command line option --space-fill to set the widget packing
  fill state at the project level.
- Added the "space-expand" custom tag attribute for the h/vbox widgets
  to set the widget packing expand state at the container level.
- Added the "space-fill" custom tag attribute for the h/vbox widgets
  to set the widget packing fill state at the container level.
- Added the "space-expand" custom tag attribute for all other widgets
  to set the widget packing expand state at the widget level.
- Added the "space-fill" custom tag attribute for all other widgets
  to set the widget packing fill state at the widget level.
- By default the original quirky widget packing method is used.
  Project level --space-expand/fill override the original method.
  Container level "space-expand/fill" override the project level method
  and the original method.
  Widget level "space-expand/fill" override the container level method,
  the project level method and the original method.

* Wed Sep 21 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Fixed the longstanding issue with expand and fill being FALSE when
  packing widgets into boxes. A message said that the original author
  couldn't get it to work, but I can't see anything wrong with it.

* Tue Sep 20 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- New widget: <colorbutton>.
- Added examples/colorbutton/colorbutton_advanced.

* Sat Sep 17 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Added widget_text.c/h and added clear, fileselect and envvar support.
- Added examples/text/text_advanced and updated the other examples.

* Thu Sep 15 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Tidied-up all of the tree widget examples.

* Wed Sep 14 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Added examples/tree/tree_item_advanced.
- Added examples/tree/tree_input_advanced.
- Added examples/tree/tree_input_file_advanced.

* Tue Sep 13 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Fixed the tree widget's problematic pixmap rendering when including
  rows from multiple sources with different icon settings.
- Fixed (or completed) the tree widget's default icon feature.

* Mon Sep 12 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Added widget_tree.c/h.

* Thu Sep 8 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Fixed a bug in _variables_export that was making the list widget hang.
- Found a bug in fill_list_by_items that doesn't show the newly reloaded
  items on a refresh. Unfortunately this is the type of bug that some
  existing appications might've been designed around so I'm leaving it.
- Added examples/list/list_advanced.

* Wed Sep 7 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Fixed a bug in fill_clist_by_items whereby the item string was being
  corrupted by the linecutter function and wouldn't refresh. Item
  directive memory requires duplicating first prior to being chopped-up.
- Added examples/table/table_advanced.

* Tue Sep 6 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Added examples/edit/edit_advanced.

* Mon Sep 5 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Tweaked and shrunk the recently added checkbox_advanced example.

* Sat Sep 3 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Created new menu, menubar and menuitemseparator examples so that now
  all of the menu related examples are unique.

* Tue Aug 30 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Fixed the tree widget's <input file> directive.
- Fixed examples 09.01-tree_attributes, 09.01-tree_items and
  09.02-tree_default_pixmaps and added list.txt.

* Mon Aug 29 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- New widget: <statusbar>.
- Modified save_menuitem_to_file to save "true" or "false" to make it
  consistent with the togglebutton widget.

* Thu Aug 25 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Overhauled the fileselect action function which includes file filters.
- Added a list_t_free() function to free list_t structs if required.

* Tue Aug 23 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Modified icon from theme code so that a gtk-missing-image is shown
  when an image isn't found, similar to the image from file code.
- Tweaked the button image loading code to better accommodate the
  togglebutton's <input> directive.
- Added support for the save action function to the togglebutton widget.

* Mon Aug 22 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- New widget: <togglebutton>.
- Purged almost all of the code marked redundant.
- Added widget_template.c/h which I've been using for a while now.

* Sun Aug 21 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Fixed invisible-char in 02.01-entry_attributes as it is a guint not a
  gchar (it worked before because the guint code was bugged).
- Updated a few examples by replacing deprecated directives.

* Sat Aug 20 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Added signals.c/h.

* Fri Aug 19 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Started to implement the togglebutton widget (create works so far).
- Fixed a bug when freeing accel_groups: it needed to be set to NULL.

* Thu Aug 18 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Added widget_button.c/h.
- Added "use-underline" support to buttons with a label directive.

* Wed Aug 17 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Added "tab-prefix", "tab-suffix" and "tab-base-index" custom tag
  attributes to the notebook widget to control automated page labelling.
  I've also added "tab-labels" to replace the existing "labels".

* Tue Aug 16 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Re-engineered a few functions within attributes.c that needed to be
  reentrant but weren't. The pointer being used to record the currently
  referenced element in an AttributeSet (a GList) was being stored within
  the AttributeSet when it should have been stored within the calling
  function. For example, clicking a button on a notebook page would emit
  a signal and an action would change the page, then GTK+ would hide the
  page including button which would emit signals for the button which
  would then iterate through the same actions causing the pointer to be
  updated amd corrupting the original loop. Yeah, it took some finding.
- Reviewed and extended the <notebook> widget: Now the page number is
  stored within the variable and it can be refreshed from a command or
  file making it possible to use another widget to change the page.

* Fri Aug 12 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Added GTK_CHECK_VERSION for gtk_widget_get_sensitive which'll use the
  deprecated GTK_WIDGET_SENSITIVE if older than 2.18.0.
- Deprecated the <visible>disabled</visible> directive in favour
  of <sensitive>false/no/0</sensitive> which is what it actually is.
- Fixed the hardcoded "gtkdialog" binary name in main.

* Thu Aug 11 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- New widget: <timer> with a custom "tick" signal.

* Wed Aug 10 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Connected-up the primary and secondary icon-press/release signals for
  the new spinbutton widget -- it's effectively an entry widget + scale,
  therefore all the GtkEntry properties apply too.
- Connected-up the changed signal for the new spinbutton widget.

* Tue Aug 9 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Modified token_store_with_argument_attr to convert signal names passed
  in from the XML separated with underscores to hyphenated strings
  (GTK+ doesn't distinguish between the two, so now we don't).
- New widget: <spinbutton>.
- Added default messages for unimplemented directives for widgets that
  I've so far refactored or recently added.

* Mon Aug 8 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Fixed an existing bug in try_set_property, the function that passes
  the tag attributes that are GTK+ widget properties to GTK+ to be set.
  The part that should have been converting a char to a guint was
  converting a char to a [UTF8] char which resulted in all guint GTK+
  widget properties being bugged; therefore "border_width" now works.
- Deprecated the "margin" custom tag attribute and removed from docs.
- Started to implement the spinbutton widget.

* Sun Aug 7 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Fixed a bug I added to the pixmap widget that caused a segfault.
- Updated the menuitem widget to support custom tag attributes of
  "stock[-id]", "icon[-name]" and "image-name" plus underscores. This
  is consistent with the extended names accepted by the tree widget.
- Updated the menuitem widget to support using the height or width
  directives to override the default theme icon size of 16.

* Sat Aug 6 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Added theme icon support to the pixmap widget: the height or width
  directives can be used to specify the "size" else it defaults to 32.
- Tweaked the new widget template somewhat.
- Renamed main.c to gtkdialog.c and main.h to gtkdialog.h.
- Updated the button widget to support using the height or width
  directives to override the default theme icon size of 20.

* Fri Aug 5 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Updated the old TODO although I'm using the issue tracker myself.
- Added widget_pixmap.c/h, the start of my refactoring intentions.
- Fixed examples 09.00-tree, 09.12-tree_one_column including list.sh.
- Added widget_comboboxtext.c/h.

* Mon Aug 1 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- The overhaul of the menu system is now complete. New checkbox,
  radiobutton and image from file menuitem widgets added and refresh and
  save action functions implemented.

* Sun Jul 31 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Discovered that the menuitems aren't realized until the menu is opened
  which means that using gtk_widget_get_realized is pointless. I've now
  replaced that within the refresh functions with an item of widget data
  named "initialised" which marks the widgets at start-up. I believe
  this is also going to be an issue with the notebook widget so the
  on_any_widget_realized method of setting tag attributes is going to
  require changing else properties won't be set until widgets get shown
  and an action function could have changed them in that time.
- Re-engineered the "block-function-signals" code so that I don't have
  to micro-manage signal handler IDs. Instead I set a global flag which
  blocks execute_action from executing any action functions. The check
  for "block-function-signals" is now done not within specific widget
  functions but at a higher level so theoretically all widgets now
  support blocking signals from action functions.

* Sat Jul 30 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Reviewed the examples, fixed a few more, commented within 17 of them.

* Fri Jul 29 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Fixed exported_column being 1 based within the examples
  09.02-tree_actions, 09.10-tree_icon_stocks and 09.11-tree_icon_names.
- Fixed all the shebangs (bashim) within the examples and used
  GTKDIALOG=gtkdialog so that they can all be easily changed with sed.
- Fixed 05.01-progress_bar_closewindow: closewindow issue.
- Fixed 05.02-progress_bar_test: closewindow issue.
- Fixed 06.00-pixmap: missing image.
- Fixed various other examples and identified the non-working ones.

* Thu Jul 28 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Set the default checkbox menuitem signal to "toggled".
- Added checkbox menuitem support for conditional function execution.
- Added the radiobutton menuitem widget (grouped by any non radiobutton
  menuitem widget), set the default signal to "toggled" and added support
  for conditional function execution.

* Wed Jul 27 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- The menu widget is in fact a menuitem widget with a submenu, so it's
  created the same way as any other menuitem which means it can now have
  an icon and the "activate" signal works on selection.
- Submenus now work by nesting menu widgets (menu == menuitem+submenu).
- Deprecated "icon" and "stock" and replaced with "imgicon" and
  "imgstock" and added "imgfile" which supports scaled images from files.
- Renamed "imgicon", "imgstock" and "imgfile" to "image-icon",
  "image-stock" and "image-file".
- Added the checkbox menuitem and checkbox="state" custom tag attribute.

* Mon Jul 25 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Added <visible> directive support to the menu widget.

* Sun Jul 24 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Added tag attribute support to the menu widget which means it's now
  possible to set label="_File" use-underline="true".
- Added the "margin" custom tag attribute to the window widget to
  control the border-width as it was previously hardcoded to 5. This
  now makes it possible to pull the menubar up into the corners.
- Added the "margin" custom tag attribute to the hbox and vbox widgets.

* Sat Jul 23 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Tidied-up the create_menuitem function (preparatory work in readiness
  for extending the menuitems) and now the GTK properties "use-stock"
  and "label" work together as expected.

* Wed Jul 20 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Added support for menuitem accelerators via the "accel-key" and
  "accel-mods" custom tag attributes and both values can be entered as
  either decimal or hexadecimal integers (when you see gdk/gdkkeysyms.h
  you'll know why ;) ). gdk/gdktypes.h holds the modifier values.

* Mon Jul 18 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Overhauled the entry widget:
- Fixed the exclusive default signal i.e. it wasn't possible to have a
  default action and another action specifying the same signal.
- Removed the odd manual emission of the default "changed" signal when
  using the fileselect function i.e. inserting text.
- Fixed widget_entry_refresh which wasn't distinguishing between <input>
  and <input file> directives (file loading wasn't implemented anyway)
  and then attempted to execute the <input file> if declared.
- Added support for the save function (now a full action function set).
- Added support for the custom tag attribute "block-function-signals".
- Added support for the "activate" signal emitted from pressing Enter.
- Added support for the "icon-press" and "icon-release" signals,
  actually prefixed with "primary-" or "secondary-" to distinguish
  between them.

* Sun Jul 17 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Added a custom tag attribute called "block-function-signals" that's
  currently being used in the h/vscale code, but it can be applied to
  other widgets if required. It blocks signal emissions when functions
  are being performed (refresh etc.) so that application developers can
  isolate signals originating from user widget manipulation.

* Sat Jul 16 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Updated the long forgotten about widget_get_type_from_pointer() which
  was in widgets.c and used exclusively by glade_support.c. I came across
  it whilst searching and found it to be only accounting for 20% of the
  widgets and I don't know what impact this would have had if any since
  only one application is using Glade. I've moved it to glade_support.c.

* Thu Jul 14 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Deprecated the badly named menu item <separator> widget and added an
  equivalent <menuitemseparator> (I'm reviewing the menu system).

* Wed Jul 13 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- New widget: <hscale>.
- New widget: <vscale>.
- Connected up the GtkScale's "value_changed" signal in glade_support.c.

* Fri Jul 8 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Overhauled the copyright and license notices atop most source files.
  Quite a few were missing, some were only snippets of the license and
  some weren't attributed to anyone. Where applicable I've included
  myself in the copyright notices since I've introduced a fair amount of
  code now. Everything is now consistently (C) 2003-2007 László Pere
  which correctly covers the period of all of his work.
- Started adding the new hscale and vscale widgets.

* Thu Jul 7 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- New widget: <comboboxentry></comboboxentry>, full action function set.
- Modified the behaviour of the comboboxentry widget's default directive
  so that text that isn't matched to any list items becomes the default
  entry text instead; very useful with has-focus="true".

* Wed Jul 6 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Modified the button and pixmap widgets' refresh functions so that
  images are only refreshed when the widgets have been realized.
- Fixed the gtkdialog_lexer.l errors I found as reported in issue 11.

* Tue Jul 5 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Added image positioning support to buttons with images and labels.

* Mon Jul 4 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Connected up the GtkComboBox's "changed" signal in glade_support.c.

* Sat Jul 2 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Added a 2.20.0 GTK+ version check for gtk_widget_get_realized and on
  false will use the deprecated GTK_WIDGET_REALIZED macro.
- Added code to widget_signal_executor to automate managing the default
  signal for widget types.
- Added comboboxtext default signal support for action and action type
  directives.

* Fri Jul 1 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- New widget: <comboboxtext></comboboxtext>, full action function set.

* Thu Jun 30 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Fixed three bugs in glade_support.c that were checking that command
  wasn't NULL when they should've been checking full_command instead
  (likely an initial mistake and then copied and pasted).
  
* Sat Jun 25 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Added width and height tag attribute support for the scrollable hbox
  and vbox to control the viewport dimensions.
- "selection_mode" will now accept 3, 2, 1, or 0 as well as multiple,

- Added hbox and vbox widget scrolling capability via the "scrollable"
  custom attribute. If scrollable="true/yes/1" then the box is placed
  inside a GtkScrolledWindow by the existing put_in_the_scrolled_window
  function.

* Thu Jun 23 2011 Thunor <thunorsif@hotmail.com>
- Simplified the search for the "selection_mode" custom attribute in
  create_tree as I found a function that finds them and returns their
  values. Also, since there exists a GTK "selection-mode" property for
  other unrelated widgets I don't now distinguish between a "_" and "-".
