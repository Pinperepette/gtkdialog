Installation
============

By default the application will run from the current folder but it's
possible to install it manually if you do the following (generic):

    cp playmusic /usr/local/bin/
    cp playmusic.desktop /usr/local/share/applications/
    cp playmusic.svg /usr/local/share/icons/hicolor/scalable/apps/
    mkdir /usr/local/share/playmusic
    cp background.png func* /usr/local/share/playmusic/

You'll need to make sure that PACKAGE_DATA_DIR within and towards the top
of playmusic points to the correct path i.e. /usr/local/share/playmusic
if that's where you installed background.png and func*

Requirements
============

Gtkdialog >= 0.8.0

Configuration
=============

Run playmusic and quit. Open ~/.playmusic/playmusicrc and edit it.
You'll likely want/need to set-up the required audio players for your
system and there's plenty of documentation in there to assist you.

Execution
=========

Usage: playmusic [FILE or FOLDER]

A FILE creates a playlist of the folder non-recursively and plays the file.
A FOLDER creates a playlist of the folder recursively and plays the first file.
No arguments resumes playing the last playlist and the last file played.

Operation
=========

Left-clicking the cover navigates to the next folder/album if one exists.
Right-clicking the cover navigates to the previous folder/album if one exists.
Middle-clicking the cover will open the cover full-size in another window.
